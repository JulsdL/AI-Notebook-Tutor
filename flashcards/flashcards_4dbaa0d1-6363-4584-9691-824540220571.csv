What is the first step in creating a retriever for a document?,The first step is loading the documents using a loader like `PyMuPDFLoader` to load documents from a PDF file.
Which function is used to load documents from a PDF file?,The function `PyMuPDFLoader` is used to load documents from a PDF file.
How are documents split into chunks for processing?,"Documents are split into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which divides the documents based on predefined rules like token limits and split characters."
What is the purpose of chunking documents?,Chunking documents into smaller parts helps in managing and processing them more efficiently for embedding and retrieval.
Which library is used for loading a pre-trained embedding model?,The `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` library is used for loading a pre-trained embedding model.
How do you specify the device for running the embedding model?,"You specify the device (e.g., 'cuda') in the `model_kwargs` parameter when loading the embedding model."
What is Meta's FAISS used for in the retriever creation process?,Meta's FAISS is used to power dense vector search by creating a vector store from the document chunks and embedding model.
How do you convert a vector store into a retriever?,You convert a vector store into a retriever using the `as_retriever` method.
What is the role of the retriever in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system?,"The retriever fetches relevant document chunks based on query vectors, providing contextually relevant responses."
Which embedding model is used in the example provided for retriever creation?,The embedding model 'JulsdL/e2erag-arctic-m' from Hugging Face is used in the example.
