What is the first step in the retriever creation process?,The first step in the retriever creation process is loading the embedding model.
Which model is used as the embedding model in the retriever creation process?,The embedding model used is 'JulsdL/e2erag-arctic-m'.
Which class and module are used to load the embedding model?,The embedding model is loaded using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class from the langchain_community.embeddings module.
On which device is the embedding model configured to run?,The embedding model is configured to run on a CUDA device.
What is the purpose of the VectorStore in the retriever creation process?,The VectorStore is created to power dense vector searches.
Which technology is used to set up the VectorStore?,Meta's FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to set up the VectorStore.
How are the documents prepared for creating the VectorStore?,The documents are split into chunks before creating the VectorStore.
Which method is called to create the VectorStore from the documents and embedding model?,The method FAISS.from_documents is called to create the VectorStore.
How is the VectorStore converted into a retriever?,The VectorStore is converted into a retriever by invoking the as_retriever() method on the vector_store object.
What are the benefits of the retriever created through this process?,"The retriever leverages the power of dense embeddings and efficient search capabilities provided by FAISS, making it effective for retrieval-augmented tasks."
