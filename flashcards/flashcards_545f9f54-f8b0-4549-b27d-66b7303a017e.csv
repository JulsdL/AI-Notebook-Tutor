What tool is used to load documents from a PDF file in the retriever creation process?,The PyMuPDFLoader is used to load documents from a PDF file.
What is the purpose of the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter in the retriever creation process?,The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is used to divide the documents into manageable chunks based on specific rules such as token limits and preferred split characters.
Which library is used to create a dense vector store in the retriever creation process?,Meta's FAISS library is used to create a dense vector store from the document chunks and the embedding model.
How do you load a pre-trained embedding model from Hugging Face to run on a CUDA device?,Use the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class with the model name and specify the device as CUDA in the model_kwargs parameter.
What is the role of the embedding model in the retriever creation process?,The embedding model is used to convert text into vectors that can be stored in the vector store for efficient retrieval.
How do you convert a vector store into a retriever?,Use the as_retriever method on the vector store to convert it into a retriever.
What is the first step in the retriever creation process?,The first step is loading the documents using PyMuPDFLoader.
Which model name is used in the provided example for the embedding model?,"The model name used is ""JulsdL/e2erag-arctic-m""."
What is the purpose of the vector store in the retriever creation process?,"The vector store holds the dense vector representations of document chunks, allowing for efficient retrieval based on query embeddings."
Which Python import is necessary to use FAISS for creating a vector store?,You need to import FAISS from langchain_community.vectorstores.
