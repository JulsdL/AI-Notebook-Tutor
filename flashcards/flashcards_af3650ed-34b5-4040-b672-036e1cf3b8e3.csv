What is the first step in creating a retriever?,The first step in creating a retriever is loading a fine-tuned embedding model from the hub using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class.
Which class is used to load the embedding model?,The HuggingFaceEmbeddings class is used to load the embedding model.
How is the model 'JulsdL/e2erag-arctic-m' loaded onto the GPU?,"The model 'JulsdL/e2erag-arctic-m' is loaded onto the GPU by setting the model_kwargs parameter to {""device"": ""cuda""} in the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class."
What library is used to set up the vector store?,Meta's FAISS library is used to set up the vector store.
What does the vector store manage?,The vector store manages the dense vectors generated by the embedding model.
How is the vector store converted into a retriever?,The vector store is converted into a retriever using the as_retriever() method.
What is the purpose of the retriever in this context?,The purpose of the retriever is to efficiently fetch relevant document vectors based on the query vectors.
What is the role of the embedding model in the retriever creation process?,"The embedding model generates dense vectors for the documents, which are then managed by the vector store and used by the retriever to find relevant information."
Which parameter in the HuggingFaceEmbeddings class specifies the device to be used?,"The model_kwargs parameter specifies the device to be used, such as ""cuda"" for GPU."
What does the FAISS library stand for?,FAISS stands for Facebook AI Similarity Search.
